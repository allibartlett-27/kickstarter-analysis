# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends - Vandy Bootcamp Module 1

## Overview of Project
#### Explain the purpose of this analysis
The purpose of this project was to show Louise how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I performed the analysis by creating a pivot table based on the Kickstarter data set. I filtered the table by outcomes and launch date to show which theater productions were successful, failed or canceled by months across multiple years.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I performed the analysis by creating new table and the CountIf formula to only show successful, failed or canceled productions based on their goals. 

### Challenges
Some issues I encountered here was I originally did not add = to my calculations, which skewed my data differently.
It took me a few trys to filter the data by month vs. years or quarters. 

## Results
### Conclusions based on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
More successful theatre productions were launched in May and June. I would avoid a theater production in October, November, or December because the number of successful campaigns is low and the margin between successful and failed campaigns is closer. Based on this data, there is a higher probability that a theater production would fail is launched in October, November, or December. 

### Conclusions based on Outcomes based on Goals
Theater productions with a goal up to $4,999 are the most successful. Theater productions with a goals of $35,000 to $44,999 were also successful but the sample size of those productions is lower, which makes it harder to determine a true sense of success. The majority of theater productions had a goal between $1,000 to $4,999 and 76% of those were successful.

### Limitations and Other Tables/Graphs 
When we are looking at the data by months, it would be interesting to know how many years of data this covers. If most successful theater productions were successful 5 years ago and have been declining to present day, this would be something Louise may want to consider as well, or if the theater productions have stayed consistent for over 10 years. 
It would also be interesting to break the theatre productions down even further into subcategories like plays, musicals, etc. to give Louise a better idea of what kind of production she may want to create for the most success.
